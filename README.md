2. **`decorators/`**

- Reusable decorators.
- Example: `field-step.decorator.ts`, `step.decorator.ts`.

3. **`interfaces/`**

- TypeScript interfaces that define the structure of configurations, settings, and more.
- Example: `environment.interface.ts`, `playwright-config.interface.ts`.

4. **`utils/`**

- Utility functions and helpers for common tasks, such as data manipulation, API calls, etc.
